React Native Developer Assessment

Software Engineer Test for Carpool
----------------------------------

> Truth can only be found in one place: the code. <br/> -- Robert C. Martin

1\. Introduction
----------------

This test is intended for candidates applying to Software Engineering positions at Carpool.

You are welcome to use JavaScript or TypeScript for the implementation.

2\. Requirements
----------------

-   Git
-   A development environment for React Native
-   Quake game (attatched in this repository)
---------

### 3.1. Log Parser

Create a React Native project to parse the Quake log file.

The log file was generated by a Quake 3 Arena server, including a great deal of information for every match.

The project should implement the following functionalities:

-   Read the log file
-   Group the game data of each match
-   Collect kill data
-   render on react a native screen

#### Example

`21:42 Kill: 1022 2 22: <world> killed Isgalamido by MOD_TRIGGER_HURT`
*The player "Isgalamido" died because he was wounded and fell from a height enough to kill him.*
`2:22 Kill: 3 2 10: Isgalamido killed Dono da Bola by MOD_RAILGUN`
*The player "Isgalamido" killed the player "Dono da Bola" using the Railgun weapon.*
Example of grouped information for each match:
"game_1": {

"total_kills": 45,

"players": ["Dono da bola", "Isgalamido", "Zeh"],

"kills": {

  "Dono da bola": 5,

  "Isgalamido": 18,

  "Zeh": 20

  }

}
Additional notes:

1.  When `<world>` kills a player, that player loses -1 kill score.
2.  Since `<world>` is not a player, it should not appear in the list of players or in the dictionary of kills.
3.  The counter `total_kills` includes player and world deaths.

### 3.2. Report

Create a script that prints a report (grouped information) for each match and a player ranking.

### 3.3. Plus

Generate a report of deaths grouped by death cause for each match.

Death causes (extracted from [source code](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/master/code/game/bg_public.h))
// means of death

typedef enum {

  MOD_UNKNOWN,

  MOD_SHOTGUN,

  MOD_GAUNTLET,

  MOD_MACHINEGUN,

  MOD_GRENADE,

  MOD_GRENADE_SPLASH,

  MOD_ROCKET,

  MOD_ROCKET_SPLASH,

  MOD_PLASMA,

  MOD_PLASMA_SPLASH,

  MOD_RAILGUN,

  MOD_LIGHTNING,

  MOD_BFG,

  MOD_BFG_SPLASH,

  MOD_WATER,

  MOD_SLIME,

  MOD_LAVA,

  MOD_CRUSH,

  MOD_TELEFRAG,

  MOD_FALLING,

  MOD_SUICIDE,

  MOD_TARGET_LASER,

  MOD_TRIGGER_HURT,

#ifdef MISSIONPACK

  MOD_NAIL,

  MOD_CHAINGUN,

  MOD_PROXIMITY_MINE,

  MOD_KAMIKAZE,

  MOD_JUICED,

#endif

  MOD_GRAPPLE

} meansOfDeath_t;

"game-1": {

  "kills_by_means": {

    "MOD_SHOTGUN": 10,

    "MOD_RAILGUN": 2,

    "MOD_GAUNTLET": 1,

    ...

  }

}
4\. Deliverable
---------------

The final output must be displayed as a very basic layout on the user app, with three sections:

1.  Games
2.  Player Rankings
3.  Total Deaths by Means (if included)

Create a React Native screen that displays this information as described. The developer must send a link with all of their commits on a git service (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
